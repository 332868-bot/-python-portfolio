## Problem
What problem were you trying to solve? Why does it matter?
Many plastic bottles and other objects have been in the sea, on the ground, and everywhere around. (hey that rhymed) Polution has been effecting the world and is causing global warming.

## Solution
How does your project work? (High-level, no heavy jargon)
My product converts plastic into fertilizer using heat to degrade the plastic into nitrogen-rich fertilizer.

## Tools
Languages, libraries, datasets, or AI models used.
3d modeled the product.

## Results
What worked? (accuracy, output, example, or result)
The product produced fertilizer, which helped plants grow much better and of a high quality.

## Learning
One important thing you learned from this project.
Something that needs to change is plastic. We need more biodegradable plastic so plastic bottles aren't clogging up beautiful places like the beach and the cities.
